# RailsGems
> Share The Gems You Love

Ever wonder what gems your favorite Rails developers like to use? _I sure have!_

That's why I built [RailsGems](https://www.railsgems.com), an easy way to discover new gems and share the gems you love.

It was built using my [Rails Blueprint](https://github.com/dalezak/rails-blueprint) to help fast track the development.

If you have any fedback or ideas, I'd [love to hear them](https://twitter.com/dalezak)!
